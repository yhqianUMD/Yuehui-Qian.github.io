> __News:__ I am looking for SDE internship starting from Summer 2024!

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Geographical Sciences](https://geog.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Leila De Floriani](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~deflo/) and [Prof. Federico Iuricich](https://fiurici.people.clemson.edu/). My research focuses on large-scale topology-based terrain modeling and analysis on Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs) generated from LiDAR points.

I received my Master's degree in Geographic Cartography and Geographic Information Engineering and my Bachelor's degree in Remote Sensing Science and Technology, both at Wuhan University, China. 

<!-- My research interest is in computational methods for earth sciences, with a special emphasis on multiphase flow and transport for CO$_2$ geological storage, physics modeling, and machine learning. I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Energy Sciences & Engineering](https://earth.stanford.edu/ere) Department at [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/)
working with Professor [Sally M. Benson](https://earth.stanford.edu/people/sally-benson). I was an ExxonMobil Emerging Energy Fellow through the [Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/03/01/new-energy-research-program-collaboration/). 


I received my Master's degree in Fluid Mechanics and Hydrology from Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. Prior to my Ph.D. at Stanford, I received my Bachelor's degree with honors from Lassonde Mineral Engineering at the University of Toronto and was nominated as [16 Grads to Watch](https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/grads-watch-16-global-engineering-leaders/). -->
